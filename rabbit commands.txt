sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues

It's a common mistake to miss the basic_ack. It's an easy error, but the consequences are serious. Messages will be redelivered when your client quits (which may look like random redelivery), but RabbitMQ will eat more and more memory as it won't be able to release any unacked messages.

sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
